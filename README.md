# Authentication

In this learning Authentication process i learn brifly about the security process involved in order to keep our user's data safe. In this project i have created a secret submiting app in which every user loged in can submit his/her secrets annomously and At the end i have used OAuth in which the user can login using their google account and the authentication process is now done by the google which is more reliable than other options.
